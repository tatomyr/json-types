# JSON X-Type applications

With the help of a Redocly [plugin](./x-types-plugin.js), **JSON X-Type** could be used in regular OpenAPI descriptions where JSON Schema is expected.
Instead of writing the `schema` keyword, you can use the `x-type` keyword with a **JSON X-Type** value.

See the examples in the [resources](./resources) directory.
